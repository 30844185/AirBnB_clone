# AirBnB clone
we are working in collaboration on the airbnb clone project. the project will allow us to better apply the notions learned in this training.
Before starting we need to analyze the project.
We need to understand how airbnb works.If we are to clone airbnb we must first understand that airbnb is a company that allows the booking of houses and hotels and also allows many house owners to stay in contact with their subjects.
For this project we have several programming sides that we need to understand.
We have the front-end side which will be the aspect that users will see when they are connected.
We will have the backend side that allows us to store the data and to be able to retrieve them in the process of data transaction, data sharing
Data integration.
